# Leevi Agency Portfolio

This project is a beautiful, modern portfolio website designed by the talented team at Leevi Agency. I stumbled upon the design in the Figma Community and was immediately inspired to bring it to life using Sass and Parcel.

## Design Inspiration

The Leevi Agency Portfolio design is sleek, sophisticated, and perfectly showcases the agency's impressive portfolio of work. The design features bold typography, stunning imagery, and a clean, minimalist layout that is sure to impress any potential client.

## Technology Used

I used Sass and Parcel to bring this design to life. Sass is a powerful preprocessor that allows you to write cleaner, more organized CSS code. Parcel, on the other hand, is a zero-configuration bundler that makes it easy to compile and bundle your Sass files into production-ready code.

## Licensing

All of the assets used in this project are licensed through Leevi Template's licensing agreement. You can find more information about the licensing agreement on their website.

## Getting Started

If you want to get started using Sass and Parcel for your own projects, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Sass by running `npm install -g sass`.
2. Install Parcel by running `npm install -g parcel-bundler`.
3. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/your-username/leevi-agency-portfolio.git`.
4. Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
5. Run `npm start` to compile the Sass files and launch the development server.
6. (optional) If you're ready to deploy your website, run `npm run build` to create a production-ready build of your website in the `dist` folder.
7. (optional) To deploy your website to GitHub Pages, run `npm run push-gh-pages`. This will build your website and push the contents of the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch of your GitHub repository, making it accessible at the URL specified in your `package.json` file under `"homepage"` (you should change this url) .

Happy coding!
